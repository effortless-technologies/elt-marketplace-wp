The biggest step in gameplay innovation in franchise history, FIFA 18 introduces <strong>Real Player Motion Technology</strong>, an all-new animation system which unlocks a new level of responsiveness, and player personality – now Cristiano Ronaldo and other top players feel and move exactly like they do on the real pitch. <strong>Player Control</strong> combined with new <strong>Team Styles and Positioning</strong> give you the tools to deliver <strong>Dramatic Moments</strong> that ignite Immersive Aospheres around the world. The World’s Game also takes you on a global journey as <strong>Alex Hunter Returns</strong> along with a star-studded cast of characters, including Cristiano Ronaldo and other European football stars. </p> <p> <br /> <strong><u>GAMEPLAY AND PRESENTATION</u></strong> </p> <p> <br /> <strong><u>Powered by Frostbite</u></strong> </p> <p> Attention to innovation in true-to-life action, new football worlds and character depth, Frostbite helps to further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds. Using movie studio-style advanced shadowing and occlusion techniques to benefit character rendering and overall pitch presentation, FIFA 18 delivers the most visually arresting and authentic football simulation ever. </p> <p> <br /> <strong><u>Player Control</u></strong> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Real Player Motion Technology:</strong>The all-new, game-changing animation system utilizes pose trajectory matching on every frame to deliver the franchise’s most responsive and fluid gameplay ever. New motion capture techniques and frame by frame animation transitions ensure gameplay accurately represents the reality of football. Real Player Motion Tech is the catalyst for an increased fidelity in movement for every player on the pitch, immediately taking authenticity to another level. </li> <li> <br /> <strong>Player Personality:</strong> Six new character archetypes and new player mapping technology differentiate players on the pitch to give them their own distinct identity. For the first time ever, real-world movements, size and attributes inform how a player moves, allowing you to feel the life-like tendencies of the world’s best. Ronaldo’s signature sprint, Sterling’s unique turns, and Robben’s distinct arm movement are all immediately recognizable in FIFA 18. </li> <li> <br /> <strong>Dribbling Overhaul:</strong>In FIFA 18, you will run at defenders with confidence knowing that the best players can change direction on a dime. New dribbling mechanics enable players to inject more creativity into 1v1 situations. Take more defined touches, make tighter turns, and explode into attack more dynamically than ever before. </li> <li> <strong><em>Responsive:</em></strong>Creative on-ball skills, contextual touches, and a re-imagining of the control dribble mechanic give players new options when building up attacks in tight spaces. Change direction with ease and feel your player respond when you escape a defender lunging to tackle. </li> <li> <strong><em>Explosive:</em></strong>Authentic and dynamic speed-based animations allow you to explode more rapidly from controlled touches into full tilt sprints. </li> </ul> <p> <strong><u>Team Styles and Positioning</u></strong> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>New Player Positioning: </strong>With more freedom in motion, your teammates examine the pitch and react accordingly; darting forward in coordinated runs, or moving into space to provide consistent attacking support. New player positioning gives you a well-balanced and spread pitch with more opportunities in time and space to read the play. </li> <li> <strong>Team Styles:</strong>A deep set of authentic playing styles attributed to several teams put the most-recognized tactics on the pitch in FIFA 18 - now in AI you will immediately recognize the tiki-taka of some of Europe’s best clubs or the high-pressing style of teams in the Premier League. Feel a change in defensive and attacking approaches every time you choose a new club or opponent. </li> <li> <strong>Dynamic Quick Substitutes:</strong>All-new context based substitution prompts allow players to easily make changes without pausing the match. Whether it's a missed chance, or necessary response to conceding a goal, you can instantly decide if a change is needed without visiting the menu. </li> </ul> <p> <br /> <strong><u>Immersive Aospheres</u></strong> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Regional Aospheres:</strong> Authentic sun positions, cinematic aosphere grading, signature pitch-side fixtures, authentic broadcast overlays in La Liga and MLS, on-pitch debris, club and stadium specific banners, adaptive commentary, and changes in pitch quality all come together to bring the most immersive football experiences to life in FIFA 18. </li> <li> <strong>High-Def Dynamic Crowds:</strong>All-new individual crowd reactions and expanded regional chant support have you feeding off the energy of your supporters. Hear authentic chants build as you mount an attack, incite realistic excitement when you score and even interact with the crowd while celebrating. </li> </ul> <p> <br /> <strong><u>Dramatic Moments</u></strong> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Wonder Goals:</strong> New locomotion and finishing animations unlock more fluid striking and heading, combining to increase the potential for more dramatic finishes. Player Personality ensures the heroes of the game stand tall in the biggest moments, finishing more often on the biggest stages. </li> <li> <strong>New Crossing Control:</strong>All-new crossing controls provide the player with a variety of options to put the ball into the box, creating dynamic attacking chances. Whipped to the spot, arching, and back-stick crosses increase the variety of delivery to accurately pick out the attacking player. </li> </ul> <p> <strong><u>THE JOURNEY: HUNTER RETURNS</u></strong> </p> <p> The World’s Game takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter returns along with a star-studded cast of characters and top football talent, like Ronaldo and other European stars.
